Why grml-gen-zshrefcard?

  It's a tedious to document the same code in two different places.
  Therefore grml-gen-zshrefcard is our poor-man's-doxygen for our zshrc.

How does it work?

  It (the Perl script genrefcard.pl) creates a new latex source file for
  our zsh-refcard from the zshrc itself and a tex input file
  (grml-zsh-refcard.tex.in).

How do I work with it?

  (quickstart)
  % cd ~/src/grml
  % git clone git://git.grml.org/grml-gen-zshrefcard.git
  % git clone git://git.grml.org/grml-etc-core.git
  % cd grml-gen-zshrefcard.git
  % make test

  The format of the inline documentation comments is described at the
  top of etc/zsh/zshrc in grml-etc-core. Additional information about
  the replacement tokens in grml-zsh-refcard.tex.in can be found at the
  top of the genrefcard.pl script.

  Make your changes to grml-etc-core and check if you're happy with the
  result of 'make test'. Only changes to the meta-information at the top
  of the refcard should go into grml-gen-zshrefcard.
